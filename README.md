# webaom
WebAOM is a simple Java applet/application that hashes files and adds them to your MyList at AniDB.

The original code is hosted at https://git.anidb.net/anidb/udp-clients/-/tree/master/webaom

This fork attempts to slightly modernize the code base by targeting Java 17 and removing the need to run an entirely separate DB to store your progress.
